## Reviews

During reviews it's better to follow some rules in order to simplify the process:
* You are splitted into teams. If your team member is asking for review -- please take a look. If this person is not from your team -- it would be cool to do review as well, but only if you have some spare time.
* During reviews use only English (because in general that is the language you are gonna do reviews in future).
* If you leave a comment and request some change -- make sure that you can describe how this change will improve the application (performance, developer experience, readability, etc). The best case is if this rule is defined in ESlint/project set of rules or you have a link to some resource (like article) that confirms your suggestion.
* Please don't postpone the work too much. In order to merge your next feature, you usually have ~1 week (which includes developing, reviewing, testing).
* If you faced a situation when you cannot resolve the PR comment (reviewer and author cannot find a solution which satisfies both) -- please ask trainers for help in common channel.
* Obvious, but important thing: be respectful during the review, remember that it's only about code, but not about you personally.
